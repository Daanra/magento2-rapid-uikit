# Magento 2 Divante Uikit Module

The Divante Uikit module has been created for and as a dependency of [Divante Rapid Theme](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento2-rapid-theme).
UI Kit is a set of most common elements on the page. Buttons, typography, form elements, colors. By changing only these elements we can easily give our website the individual character, without costly and time-consuming design/customization process of individual views. This is a reasonable compromise between using a default skin and designing your own.

## Compatibility
* Same as for [Divante Rapid Theme](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento2-rapid-theme)
 
## Additional information
* Any additional information can be found directly on Uikit's website: [http://rapid.divante.co/uikit](http://rapid.divante.co/uikit)
